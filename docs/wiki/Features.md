# Features Overview 🎀

The "For My Valentine" project is packed with cute and interactive features designed to make the proposal experience memorable.

## 💌 Personalization & Link Generator

The core of the app is the ability to create a custom URL.
- **Dynamic Greeting:** The URL parameters `?v=ValentineName&y=YourName` are used to customize every message on the page.
- **Easy Sharing:** Once names are entered, a "Copy Link" button provides the exact URL to send.

## ✨ Vibe Match Calculator

A playful "Compatibility" check!
- **Algorithm:** Uses the first letters of both names to calculate a "match percentage".
- **Visuals:** Heart animations and progress bars make it feel interactive.

## 📅 The Date Planner

If they say "Yes", they are taken to the Date Planner:
- **Food Selection:** Choose from various cuisines (Pizza, Sushi, Tacos, etc.).
- **Location Picker:** Decide where to go (Park, Cinema, Restaurant).
- **Activity/Dessert:** Extra details to round out the plan.
- **Time/Date:** A clean UI for picking the schedule.

## 💾 Data Persistence

- **LocalStorage:** Even if the tab is closed, the progress remains in the browser.
- **Download Plan:** Once "Officialized", a `.txt` file with all the date details is automatically generated and downloaded for the user.
- **Developer Debug:** Typing `getResponses()` in the console reveals the full stored JSON data.

## 📧 Email Integration (Optional)

Using **Formspree**, you can receive an instant email notification whenever someone completes the proposal process, ensuring you never miss a "Yes"!
